## About the Dataset

The PIDSimTest dataset is a simulation-based dataset designed for studying and evaluating PID controller behaviour under diverse configurations. Developed in collaboration with an industrial partner, the dataset includes system response data for various machine setups, supporting research into:

- Parameter tuning strategies.
- Benchmarking control methods.
- Robustness and adaptability testing.
- Machine learning applications, such as clustering and regression.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset includes:
1. **Simulation Configurations**: Detailed settings for PID parameters (\(K_p\), \(K_i\), \(K_d\)) and scenarios with and without a brake assistant.
2. **Raw Data**: Time-series data capturing system responses for pressure and speed.
3. **Derived Metrics**: Key metrics computed from the raw data for analysis.
